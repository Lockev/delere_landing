        2. Delere’s Service
      </h2>
      <div class="flex flex-col gap-6 pb-24">
        <p>
          In the context of using our service, which aims to clean up email
          boxes of various newsletters, spam, and unwanted emails, we manipulate
          various data related to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          For complete transparency with Delere users, here is the different
          data manipulated when using the service, for each functionality:
        </p>

        <p class="underline">Newsletters management</p>
        <p>
          The newsletters’ management includes the automatic scan of your email
          box. We look for a specific field in the mails that confirms their
          belonging to a newsletter. The content of your emails is not consulted
          nor saved in our databases. However, we consult the sender of the
          email as well as the metadata, which contains information about the
          email.
        </p>
        <p>
          The user alone decides if they wish to unsubscribe from a newsletter
          and is the only one capable of doing so.
        </p>
        <p>
          The newsletter's status is the only field stored in our databases,
          namely whether the unsubscribe has been performed. This status is also
          provided by the user.
        </p>

        <p class="underline">Automatic emails deletion</p>
        <p>
          Automation of email deletion is entirely configurable, from deletion’s
          frequency to the age of the last email to be removed. We also inform
          you that these emails are moved to the trash can of your inbox for a
          retention period that varies depending on your service (usually 30
          days). After this period, the trash can is automatically emptied. It
          is possible for the user to retrieve an inadvertently deleted email.
        </p>
        <p>
          Delere doesn’t store any personal data other than your mail address.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 class="mb-6 font-extrabold text-2xl text-black font-display">
        3. Data retention
      </h2>
      <div class="flex flex-col gap-6 pb-24">
        <p>
          Only the data necessary for the use of Delere is stored in our
          databases : the user email address. Data related to a user is deleted
          as soon as their account is deleted.
        </p>
        <p>
          The deletion of the user’s account can be initiated in the 'Profile'
          tab and can take up to 48 hours from the deletion request launch.
        </p>
